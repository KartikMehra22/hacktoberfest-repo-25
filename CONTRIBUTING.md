# Contributing Guide

Thanks for helping! This repo is **opted in** to Hacktoberfest (topic: `hacktoberfest`).  
Your PR will count if it is merged, receives an overall approving review, **or** we add the label `hacktoberfest-accepted`.

## Ground Rules
- Be respectful (see Code of Conduct).
- One focused change per PR. Small, reviewable commits.
- Link an issue when possible. If none exists, open one first.

## Workflow
1. Fork â†’ create feature branch.
2. Add/Update tests and docs.
3. Run lint/tests locally and ensure CI passes.
4. Open PR using the template.

## Quality Bar (examples)
- Code: follows style guide and passes CI.
- Docs: complete sentences, examples, screenshots where helpful.
- Tests: cover new logic, keep runtime short.

## Anti-Spam
Low-effort PRs (mass typo edits, whitespace-only changes, duplicated PRs, etc.) may be labeled `spam` or `invalid` and will **not** count.
